# Step 1 

Renamed example-package to ideogram, and changed routes.

#Step 2.

Removed code dealing with Notes collection in methods and lib directory.

TBD import ideogram in HelloWorldPage.jsx

# Step 3 (document later)
# Step 4 ( Cloned ideogram into general webapp directory. All the files can be accessed under ideogram. Not sure if this is the right way to get it working. )
